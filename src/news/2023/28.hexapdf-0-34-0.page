title: HexaPDF 0.34.0 - Optional Content aka Layers

The highlight of this release is the support for optional content aka layers.

**Optional content** allows one to selectively show or hide content. It is most often used to
provide something akin to layers, think a building plan with separate layers for the walls,
electrical infrastructure, furniture and so on. However, it can also be used for something more
mundane, like [hiding the answers of a quiz](/examples/composer_optional_content.html).

Apart from this larger change there is a new style property [HexaPDF::Layout::Style#fill_horizontal]
which allows a text fragment to fill the remaining space of a line. This is very useful when
creating table of content entries.

There is new documentation for the optional content feature and the document creation section got a
new [how-tos section](/documentation/document-creation/how-tos.html) which will be expanded in the
future.

As always, have a look at the [changelog] for an overview of all changes.
