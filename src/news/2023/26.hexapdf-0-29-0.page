title: HexaPDF 0.29.0 - PAdES Compatible Digital Signatures
created_at: 2023-01-30 23:45:00 +01:00

This release features major internal changes for the support of digital signatures. The whole code
was refactored and now HexaPDF itself creates the necessary CMS signed-data structures.

Due to this changes HexaPDF is now able to support **PAdES-BES level B-B and B-T** signatures!

Additionally, it is now *very* easy to create digital signatures via HSM calls:

~~~ ruby
require 'hexapdf'

# Set up client for HSM module
client = ...

doc = HexaPDF::Document.open(ARGV[0])
signing = lambda {|digest_method, data| client.sign_raw(digest_method, data) }
doc.sign("signed.pdf", external_signing: signing,
                       certificate: client.signing_certificate,
                       certificate_chain: client.certificate_chain)
~~~

As always, have a look at the [changelog] for an overview of all changes.
