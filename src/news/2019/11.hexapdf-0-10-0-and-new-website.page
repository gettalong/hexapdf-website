This minor release brings some enhancements to the `hexapdf` command line application: more
information when listing images with the `hexapdf images` command and a completely revamped `hexapdf
inspect` command with much more functionality. If you wanna see the inspection command in action,
have a look the ["Analysing PDFs" how-to guide](/documentation/basics/analysing-pdfs.html).

There are also bug fixes for various reported problems, most notably for loading and saving of
encrypted and signed PDFs and for handling unknown/wrongly structured PDF objects better.

As always, have a look at the [changelog] for an overview of all changes.

In addition to these changes to the library, you might have noticed already that HexaPDF also got a
new website:

* HexaPDF now finally has a logo that was inspired by Adobe's PDF logo as well as hexagons
  (naturally) - yeah!

* The [documentation](/documentation/) part of the website has been restructured and extended to
  make it easier to find what you need. There are now tutorials, key topics and how-to guides well
  as a reference section (n.b. restructured in 2022). These sections will be filled with more
  content in the future.

* The styling of the website has also been adjusted. For example, there are now table of content
  menus for most pages and a breadcrumb trail for navigation.

All in all the website should provide a better experience now. If you find problems or have
suggestions, please [report them](https://github.com/gettalong/hexapdf-website/issues) - thank you!
