This release contains changes and additions across many different parts of HexaPDF. It also includes
**breaking changes** with respect to the main [HexaPDF::Document] class as well as for
[HexaPDF::Layout::TextBox]:

* During the reworking of the revision handling it became clear that a breaking change for the main
  document class was necessary so as to make it harder to create an invalid PDF document.

* The text box now uses the whole available width/height when aligning to the center or
  right/bottom. If this was not done, the text would not appear to be correctly aligned.

Among the other changes are the new ability of `hexapdf modify` to remove or flatten annotations and
a new convenience class for creating and working with destination objects (think: in-document links).

The documentation side saw the addition of a **howto page on [migrating from Prawn]**. This howto
shows, among other things, a full example in Prawn and HexaPDF and a mapping from Prawn methods to
equivalent HexaPDF methods.

And also with respect to the documentation the [HexaPDF::Layout::Style] documentation has been
updated to include visual examples.

As always, have a look at the [changelog] for an overview of all changes.
