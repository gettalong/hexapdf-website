The second release of HexaPDF is now available. The most promiment changes concern the `hexapdf`
application which gained, among other things, support for [merging PDF files][hp-modify]. However,
the internal library structure has also been adapted and various bugs fixed. See the [changelog] for
details.

The website has also seen some enhancements, from an added explanation on the landing page regarding
what the AGPL as license means to a new documentation section providing the [manual page] of the
`hexapdf` application and an HTML version of the [changelog].

Plans for the near future include TrueType font subsetting and image extraction support. If you like
