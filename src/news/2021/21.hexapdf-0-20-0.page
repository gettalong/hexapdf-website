title: HexaPDF 0.20.0 - Digital Signatures

The big, new feature of this release is the support for **digital signatures**! Signing a document
is now as easy as invoking [HexaPDF::Document#sign] and providing the few necessary arguments like
the certificate and private key. Also have a look at the [Signing PDFs] howto guide for getting
started!

In addition to adding one or more digital signatures to a PDF document, reading and validating - in
a very basic way - of signatures is also supported. And information about digital signatures is
shown when invoking the `hexapdf info` command on a PDF.

Aside from digital signatures there were some improvements when working with interactive forms and
annotations, like a convenience method for creating an appearance.

Since working with digital signatures involves stressing the incremental writing facilities, some
bugs were fixed and the output optimized (i.e. the number of objects needed for the added revision
was further reduced). There was one bug that led to creating invalid PDF files when using
incremental writing together with the `optimize: true` option; so updating is recommended!

As always, have a look at the [changelog] for an overview of all changes.
