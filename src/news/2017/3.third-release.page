This third release is about two major features: TrueType font subsetting support and CLI
enhancements.

With the introduction of TrueType font subsetting, PDF files using the [HexaPDF::Content::Canvas]
API will now be much smaller when TrueType fonts are used. HexaPDF does font subsetting by default
now but this can be disabled on a font-by-font basis, see
[HexaPDF::FontLoader::FromConfiguration::call].

The other major overhaul was with respect to the `hexapdf` application. The `hexapdf modify` command
was split into three individual commands to allow easier use:

* [`hexapdf modify`][hp-modify] for modifying an existing file,
* [`hexapdf merge`][hp-merge] for merging multiple PDF files into a single PDF file, and
* [`hexapdf optimize`][hp-optimize] for easily optimizing PDF files.

Additionally, the `hexapdf extract` command was renamed to [`hexapdf files`][hp-files] since a new
[`hexapdf images`][hp-images] command was added. The later can be used to list or extract images
embedded in a PDF file.

The HexaPDF library itself also gained some new features, the most important one being the correct
handling of hybrid-reference PDF files. Most of you won't know what these special PDF files are but
if you have used HexaPDF before and a file was corrupted when writing, there is a good chance that
the input file was such a hybrid-reference file.

As always, have a look at the [changelog] for an overview of the changes.
