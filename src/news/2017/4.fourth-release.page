HexaPDF continues to grow and mature, with this release bringing composite font support and many CLI
enhancements.

Texts in PDF can be created using *simple* fonts or *composite* fonts where **composite fonts are
much more capable**, allowing the use of fonts in the OpenType font format and vertical writing.
HexaPDF already produced text using the composite font PDF structures and with this release it is
also able to handle composite fonts for text extraction and such.

On the CLI side I got requests for **better verbosity control** and **batch processing**. Therefore
I created a new [`hexapdf batch`][hp-batch] command that can be used to execute a command on several
PDF files.

This is especially useful when dealing with small files since the startup overhead is gone: When
running `hexapdf batch 'info {}'` on my set of test files, it takes only about 14 seconds compared
to 150 seconds running `hexapdf info` the usual way!

Additionally, **in-place processing of PDF files** is now possible and **embedded TrueType fonts can
be optimized**, sometimes leading to big file size improvements.

Memory usage and text generation performance has been improved, too. **HexaPDF is now about as fast
as Prawn** in raw text output when using the standard PDF fonts, and much faster when using TrueType
fonts, while generating smaller files. Have a look at the [text rendering benchmark] to see the
whole comparison and some caveats.

As always, have a look at the [changelog] for an overview of the changes.

For the next release I will concentrate on bringing more advanced text features to HexaPDF, like box
layouting and support for kerning. **If you have a request**, drop me an
[e-mail](mailto:t_leitner@gmx.at) or [open an issue]!
