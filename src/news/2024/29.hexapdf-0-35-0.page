This release contains many small features and fixes and **breaking changes**. So make sure you read
the [changelog] before upgrading!

The most notable additions and changes are:

* The document layout engine gained support for **fallback fonts**. Just define the fallback fonts
  using the new configuration option 'font.fallback' and you are set.

  ![fallback font example](assets/fallback_fonts.png){: style="border: 1px solid black; display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

  The fallback font support is also used when generating appearances for AcroForm text fields.

* It is now possible to use the document layout functionality for a single canvas/page via the new
  [HexaPDF::Content::CanvasComposer] class, easily instantiated via
  [`canvas.composer`][HexaPDF::Content::Canvas#composer].

* The style properties 'align' and 'valign' have been renamed (**breaking change**) to 'text_align'
  and 'text_valign' so that the old names can be used for box placement. With the addition of the
  style property 'mask_mode' one has now even more control over box placement, e.g. overlaying boxes
  is now possible (see the [added example](/examples/composer_mask_mode.html)).

* The new 'psd' command for `hexapdf inspect` provides easier to read output for page content
  streams, e.g. by decoding the text output parts and showing the nesting levels.

As always, have a look at the [changelog] for an overview of all changes.
