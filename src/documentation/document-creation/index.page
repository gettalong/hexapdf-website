<h1>Introduction</h1>

This documentation section is about creating a new PDF document and its contents from scratch. So
think *creating an invoice* and not *combining pages from multiple documents*.

There are basically two ways to achieve this with HexaPDF:

* By using the high-level document layout functionality available in the [HexaPDF::Layout] module
  standalone or through [HexaPDF::Composer].

  This is the recommend way to create documents. See {link: document-layout.html} for details.

* By manually creating and building the contents yourself using the low-level
  [HexaPDF::Content::Canvas] API.

  This is possible but for complex documents you will probably re-implement all the logic that is
  already available in the document layout functionality of HexaPDF.
