# Digital Signatures

Digital signatures are used to authenticate the content of PDF files and of users. When a digital
signature is applied, it stores the state of the document at the signing time as well as information
about the signer. The signer is identified by their X.509 certificate and private key.


## How Signing Works

The digital signature and associated information is stored in a [signature
dictionary][HexaPDF::Type::Signature]. And that signature dictionary is the value of a [signature
form field][HexaPDF::Type::AcroForm::SignatureField].

So to sign a PDF document there must either be an existing signature field to fill in or a new one
must be created. Since a signature is associated with a form field, it is possible to visually
represent the signature with an appearance stream.

When a PDF file is signed, the signature dictionary is filled with all the necessary information,
like the signing time, the signing reason or whether the signed document should allow further
changes.

Then the PDF file is written but it is still incomplete. If there are no existing signatures, one
has the choice to either save the complete file or just append a new revision by using the
incremental writing feature. Once there are existing signatures only incremental writing may be done
because otherwise the existing signatures would be invalidated.

The written file is analysed and the offset and length of the placeholder for the actual
cryptographic signature is determined. This information is filled back into the written file into
the appropriate field of the signature dictionary.

Afterwards a digest over the whole file minus the placeholder is taken and this digest is then
signed with the provided certificate and private key (or sent to an external signing provider). The
resulting signature structure is embedded into the written file and now the PDF file is properly
finished.

**Note**: Since the PDF document needs to be written to be properly signed, no changes to it can be
made afterwards. So to work with the signed document, one has to load it again.


## Types of Signatures

The PDF specifications defines different types of signatures:

* **Certification signature** (aka author signature)

  There can be only *one* certification signature on a PDF document and it has to be the first one.
  This type of signature allows the author of a PDF document to define what kind of changes may be
  applied to the signed document so that the signature is not invalidated. See the [next
  section](#docmdp) for details.

* **Approval signatures** (aka recipient signatures)

  These are the standard type of signatures and what is normally done when signing an existing
  document. Such a signature basically says that the signer approves of the signed document. For
  example, when digitally signing a contract both (or more) parties sign the document, thereby
  agreeing to it.

* **Time stamp signatures**

  These signatures were introduced with PDF 2.0 and are used when the time of signing is important.
  They use a trusted time stamp server to receive a signed time-stamp token.


## Restricting Changes to a Signed Document {#docmdp}

When using a certification signature, it is possible to restrict the changes so that any unallowed
change invalidates the signature.

This is done via the so called DocMDP transformation method set on the signature dictionary which
defines a set of permissions that have to be followed. The following three types of permissions are
available:

1. No changes.
2. Filling in forms and signing.
3. Filling in forms, signing and annotation creation, deletion and modification.

Preventing any modifications with option 1 is useful, for example, when creating signed invoices.
Any and all modifications will be flagged by PDF readers.

Option 2 is the default if nothing is specified and allows users to fill out the form fields and
sign the PDF.

Option 3 allows in addition to the permitted changes of option 2 the creation, deletion and
modification of annotations. Note that in this case. it might be possible to change the document in
a way that it still validates but misleads the recipients (see the [PDF Insecurity
website](https://pdf-insecurity.org/).

The default signing handler supports this feature via the
[HexaPDF::Document::Signatures::DefaultHandler#doc_mdp_permissions=] method.
